# Equations -> svg

Write all equations you want into equations.yaml. You can define short cuts as well. Please check the example file in the reposotory to understand how it works.

Call `python create_equations.py`. It renders all new entries as seperate svg file that you can then copy-paste into google slides/docs/calc etc.
